<a name="about"></a>
# 𝔸𝕓𝕠𝕦𝕥 -
The Geek Bot is built from scratch and consists of a programmer's search feature that enables the users to search various programming concepts and returns the list of the top articles from the GeeksforGeeks website along with the links.It also has a feature that when called, returns the list of all ongoing coding events going along the world.We have also implemented a profanity filter that identifies bad words by any user and purges them.
It is currently being used in our Discord server, and the bot has been very helpful to all the members.
